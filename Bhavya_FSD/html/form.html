                                                            *Parameters for Form*
      action: defines where the form data is sent after submission
      method: defines how the form data is sent. This matters for both security and URL format.
              ***values that method can contain:
              The two primary methods are:

                (1)GET:
                Appends the form data to the URL query string.
                Example: submitting username=alex and email=a@b.com →
                http://example.com/?uname=alex&eid=a%40b.com
                Pros: easy to bookmark/share, quick for simple searches.
                Cons: data is visible in the URL (not safe for passwords).
                
                (2)POST:
                Sends the form data in the HTTP request body (not in the URL).
                Pros: safer for sensitive data, no length limitation like GET.
                Cons: not bookmarkable, slightly more overhead.
                ex.
                The browser will request:
                    POST /submit HTTP/1.1
                    Host: example.com
                    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
                    Content-Length: 29
                    uname=alex&eid=alex%40gmail.com
                Here the form data (uname=alex&eid=alex%40gmail.com) is in the body of the HTTP request, not in the URL.
                That makes it less visible (not in the address bar, not in browser history).
                Also allows sending larger amounts of data than a URL would allow.
                
                (3)Rarely used, but exist:
                PUT, DELETE, PATCH → supported by HTML5 but usually need JavaScript/AJAX. Mostly for REST APIs, not regular forms.
      enctype:
    -->
    <form action="#" method="get">
        <!-- 
            Fieldset is used to ......
        -->
        <fieldset>
            <legend>Information</legend>
            <label for="uname">Username</label>
            <!--                                    *******input parameters********
                type:   defines the kind of input (text, password, email, tel, number, etc.). 
                        Each type gives the browser special behaviors (like validation or a special keyboard on mobile).

                id:     unique identifier in the page → lets <label for="id"> link to the input, or JavaScript find it.

                name:   the key that will appear in the form submission data.
                        ex. <input name="uname" value="alex">
                        data sent as uname=alex
                        if name is not written it will not be sent to server

                autofocus:      automatically puts the cursor in that field when the page loads.

                autocomplete:   suggests saved values (like saved usernames, emails, addresses, etc.).
                                 Can be "on", "off", or more specific hints like "email", "username", "current-password".
                                 
                placeholder:    hint text shown inside the input until the user types something.
                maxlength:      maximum number of characters allowed.
                required:       makes the field mandatory before the form can be submitted
                value:          pre-fills the input with default text/value.
             -->
            <input type="text" id="uname" name="uname" autofocus autocomplete="on" placeholder="User Name" maxlength="20"
                required />
            <br>
            <label for="eid">Email</label>
            <input type="email" placeholder="abc@gmail.com" required name="eid" />
            <br>
            <label>Password</label>
            <input type="password" placeholder="ex. Abcd@123" required minlength="8" maxlength="12" />
            <br>
            <label>Phone</label>

            <!-- 
            
            What effect does type="tel" add?

                Unlike password or email, tel does not add automatic validation.

                It doesn’t check if input is only digits, or enforce formats like phone numbers.

                However, browsers (especially on mobile devices) show a numeric keypad when focused, which makes it easier for the user to enter digits.

                If you want validation (like only digits or specific phone number formats), you’d add a pattern -->

            <input type="tel" name="phone" placeholder="9999777745" required />
